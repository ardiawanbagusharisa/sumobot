# Sumobot
Sumobot is a 2D, top-down sumo robot battle game intended to encourage player to learn the very basic of programming and artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by real [Sumobot competition](https://www.sumobot.ca/competition) and [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/leaderboards), we want to make this game (also AI competition platform) to be as simple and as open as possible.

# Our purposes 
1. Enhance the players' motivation and encourage players to learn at least the concept of computational thinking, and eventually programming basics and AI. It is predicted that in the future there would be more jobs related to STEM including AI. 
2. Create a sense of experimentation for the players to develop their logical thinking by providing live command terminal and AI script submission. 
3. Players may use the AI scripts they have created as portfolio. Imagine, you are a top player in one of the leaderboards, it proves that you have technical skill. Therefore, it increase your chance to find a software or AI engineering job, hopefully. 

## For Players
Go to [players page](https://github.com/ardiawanbagusharisa/sumobot/wiki/Players-Page) if you are a Sumobot player and want to learn how to play the game, and how to create your own AI script or want join for the AI competition. 

## For Developers
Go to [developers page](https://github.com/ardiawanbagusharisa/sumobot/wiki/Developers-Page) if you are a developer who want to contribute in building the platform.
