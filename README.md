# sumobot
A repo for sumobot: AI Competition Game with the goal is to encourage player to learn basic programming and also AI. 

Sumobot is a 2D, top-down sumo robot battle intended to encourage player to learn the very basic of programming and artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by real Sumobot competition and Battlesnake, we want to make this game as simple and as open as possible. 

#### Our noble purposes are: 
1. Encourage players to learn basic programming, or at least the concept of computational and logical thinking. 
2. Enhance the players' motivation to learn about artificial intelligence (AI), because in the future there would be more jobs related to STEM. 
3. Create a sense of experimentation for the players to develop their logical thinking by creating interesting feature such as evolving in-game objects, level editor, live coding, and AI submission. 
4. Players may use the AI scripts they have created as portfolio. Imagine, you are a top player in one of the leaderboards, it proves that you have technical skill. Therefore, it increase your chance to find a software or AI engineering job, hopefully.

#### How to clone
1. Clone this repo to your local.
2. Put it inside your local Unity project. 
3. Open your Unity, it will rebuild the project. 

This repo will only contains unity mandatory folders: 
1. Assets/ – Your game assets (scripts, prefabs, scenes, textures, etc.).
2. Packages/ – Manages package dependencies.
3. ProjectSettings/ – Stores project configurations.

These folders and files should be ignore to keep minimum size of the repo: 
* Library/ – Auto-generated, contains local caches.
* Logs/ – Debugging logs.
* Temp/ – Temporary files.
* Obj/ – Build artifacts.
* UserSettings/ – Local user settings.
* .vs, .sln, .csproj, .unityproj (if using Visual Studio) – Local IDE-specific files.
* Builds/ – Your compiled game (upload to releases instead).
* MemoryCaptures/ – Debugging snapshots.
